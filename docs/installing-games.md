# Installing games (and programs)
Now for the fun part! Installing the games!

## TI-84 Plus CE
Go to either [cemetech.net](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/browse/84plusce) or [ticalc.org](https://www.ticalc.org/pub/84plusce/) and download some games!

Once you download the games, unpack the zip, and send the .8xp/.8xv files to your calc as in [Installing a Shell](/installing-shell).

Now, they should show up in Cesium! To make sure that the programs are saved during a RAM reset, archive the programs by pushing "alpha", then "enter", and finally "alpha" to check the "Archived" checkbox.
